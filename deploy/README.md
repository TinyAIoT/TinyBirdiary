# senseBox Eye x Birdiary
I am using the bird classification trained by Anni. Images are continuously captured at 6.6 FPS and cached in a ring buffer. Roughly every 0.7 seconds the most recent image from the ring buffer is classified. If it is not background, the classification result and all images in the ring buffer are send out via wifi and mqtt.
